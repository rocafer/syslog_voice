To fix the "Failed to parse saved session file" error in Linux, you can try the following steps:

1. Open a terminal or console.
2. Make sure you have root access or use the sudo command for the following operations.
3. Create the missing directory by running the command: 
   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/gdm3/.config/mutter/sessions
   ```
4. Change the ownership of the directory to the gdm user by running:
   ```
   sudo chown -R gdm:gdm /var/lib/gdm3/.config/mutter/sessions
   ```
5. Confirm that the directory now exists and belongs to the gdm user by running:
   ```
   ls -ld /var/lib/gdm3/.config/mutter/sessions
   ```
   You should see output similar to:
   ```
   drwxr-xr-x 2 gdm gdm 4096 Jul 16 09:59 /var/lib/gdm3/.config/mutter/sessions
   ```
6. Restart your system or the display manager (e.g., GDM) to apply the changes.
   ```
   sudo systemctl restart gdm
   ```
   or
   ```
   sudo service gdm restart
   ```

After following these steps, the error message should no longer occur as the necessary directory will be created.
